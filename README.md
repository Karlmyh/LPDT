# Locally differentially Private Decision Tree (LPDT)

This repository implements **LPDT**, the Locally differentially Private Decision Tree described in the paper Decision Tree for Locally Private Estimation with Public Data accepted for NeurIPS 2023.
The implementation is based on pure Python with the following required packages:

- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Numba
- Scipy
